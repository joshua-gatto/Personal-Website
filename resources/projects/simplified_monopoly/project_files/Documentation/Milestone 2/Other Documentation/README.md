# Monopoly

## Project Description
This is Group 16's entry for SYSC3110's Monopoly Project. Also, please note that although each deliverable has an author, all parts of the project were collaborated on by multiple group members. These collaborations can be outlined through the various commits made on GitHub.

Exclaimer: This README file is best read on GitHub and was authored by Jeremy Trendoff.

## Deliverables
### Milestone 1
The Description for Milestone is as follows: 

A text-based playable version of the game, i.e.,players should be able to play the game via the console using the keyboard. There should be a command to print the state of each player (where they are on the board, how much money they have, which properties they own), a command to buy the property they landed on (if available), and a command to pass your turn to the next player. Events such as landing on a property owned by another player (and therefore paying the indicated rent), the bankruptcy of a player, etc. should be printed to the console when applicable. Also required: the UML modeling of the problem domain (class diagramswith complete variable and method signatures, and sequence diagrams for important scenarios), detailed description of the choice of data structures and relevant operations: you are providing an initial design and implementation for the Model part of the MVC.

In this milestone, Group 16 has prepared a Jar file containing all source files. We have also prepared documentation to futher understand the development and design of this project. We have created a UML file, Sequence diagrams for buying property, quitting the game, paying rent, and going bankrupt. We have also outlined our design decisions and provided a user manual for the project. The source code has also been documented using javadoc if you would like to look at the source code on out GitHub repository. 

### Milestone 2
The Description for the Milestone is as follows:

GUI-based version (now youâ€™re adding the View and the Controller!) of the game. Display must be in a JFrame, anduserinput is via the mouse. You havefreedom for other GUI decisions. Also required: Unit tests for the Model.

There have also been some changes made to the project from the first milestone. These changes are outlined in the change log later in this README.

## The ChangeLog
### Milestone 1
Milestone 1 was the first iteration of this project and, therefore, we have not made any changes to the project yet. In future milestones, our design changes will be documented in this section. If you like to learn more about our design choices, please read our design decisions document and the rest of our provided documentation.

### Milestone 2
In milestone 2, team were required to create a GUI for there Monopoly game. Previously in milestone 1, the game was ran in the console. The change to a GUI has prompted some changes to our code. Firstly, we have restructured our Game class into the model responsible for the business logic of the game. Previously, the Game class also implemented the console outputs. A test class has also been created to validate the logic of out Game model. Inside of that game class, we have implemented an enum to the states of the game. On the recommendation of our TA, we have made changes to the Board class to use an ArrayList for the board and an initProperties() method to initialize the board. Also on the recommendation of the TA, we have created the class Ownable to represent ownable tiles. This will now be the parent class of Property, Railroad, and Ultility. This provides an extra layer of abstraction for tiles. We now follow the MVC design for our application. We have added a View and a Controller to the project. The view is broken down into a GameFrame class that implements the GameView interface which provides the boilerplate for handling game states. Our controller, GameController, controls what happens when the player presses a button. To read more about our design desicions, please read our Design_Desicions document. This can be found in the Documentation folder under Milestone 2.

### Milestone 4

## Issues 
### Milestone 1
- When the game is won, the winning player may have to go through one extra turn before they are declared the winner.
- There is some code written that should be useful later, but will not be used now. This results in a bit less code cleanliness. 
- It may make sense for the Game class methods, pay() and purchaseProperty(), to move to the piece class.  

### Milestone 2
- In order to run the tests on the model, you must input player names via a JOPtionPane for each test.
- In the game controller, the switch statement in actionPerformed() does not work with our State enum.  
- There is some code written that should be useful later, but will not be used now. This results in a bit less code cleanliness.

### Milestone 4

## The Roadmap Ahead
### Milestone 1
Our next steps for this project are to finalize the testing of each of the model classes using JUnit testing to provide more insight into some bugs that we might have not caught yet. The team also plans to look at how we can improve our models. One way to do this may be to implement the Java Event Model into our code and use interfaces to decrease coupling between our classes. Of course, any feedback from milestone 1 will be addressed and fixed as well. These changes will all be outlined in the change log for milestone 2.

### Milestone 2
Our next steps for this project are to implement the Java Event Model into our design. Instead of passing specific arguments to the view from the model, we should be passing different events that the view can process. This, plus adding in any recommendations from our TA should put Team 16 on track for Milestone 3.
