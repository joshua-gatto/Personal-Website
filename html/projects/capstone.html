				<h2>Details</h2>
				<h3>Software</h3>
				<p>
					The obstacle detection team used a variety of tools and resources during the development of the neural network. 
					The primary resource for dataset development was Roboflow.
				</p>
				<img id="roboflow_logo" src="../../resources/projects/capstone/roboflow_logo.png" alt="roboflow logo">
				<p>
					Roboflow is a tool that allows developers to mask images and compile datasets for training neural networks. 
					Additionally, Roboflow provides statistical analysis on the dataset called a 'health check'.<br>
					The obstacle detection team used Roboflow and its health check feature compile and refine the datasets.
				</p>
				<img id="ubuntu_logo" src="../../resources/projects/capstone/ubuntu_logo.jpg" alt="ubuntu logo">
				<p>
					The obstacle detection team used Ubuntu OS as the development environment as well as the deploy envirnonment. 
					Ubuntu provides a lightweight interface with minimal memory overhead. The Linux kernel based operating system's 
					prominent use in expermiental and cutting edge development in artificial intelligence was an advantage to the 
					team.
