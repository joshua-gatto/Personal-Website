                        <h3>Autonomous Vehicle Initiative</h3>
                        <p>
                            The goal of the autonomous vehicle initiative was to develop a level 5 (Full Driving Automation) autonomous driving 
                            system. The project was divided into several teams, making use of the parallelized workflows in order to maintain a 
                            7 month development cycle. Near the end of the project term, the components were be combined and integrated.<br>
                            This project marks the first endeavor into in house development of an autonomous driving solution at Carleton 
                            University.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Obstacle Detection System</h3>
                        <p>
                            The obstacle detection team's main objective was to develop a vision system for a vehicle that can identify multiple 
                            types of traffic cones, potholes, and barricades using an artificially intelligent neural network. The main 
                            components of the vision system included a high frame rate camera, a test vehicle, and an Nvidia Jetson Nano single 
                            board computer to run the neural network in real-time.

                        <p>
                            The obstacle detection team used a variety of tools and resources during the development of the neural network. 
                            The primary resource for dataset development was Roboflow.

                        <p>
                            Roboflow is a tool that allows developers to mask images and compile datasets for training neural networks. 
                            Additionally, Roboflow provides statistical analysis on the dataset called a 'health check'.<br>
                            The obstacle detection team used Roboflow and its health check feature compile and refine the datasets.

                        <p>
                            The obstacle detection team used Ubuntu OS as the development environment as well as the deploy envirnonment. 
                            Ubuntu provides a lightweight interface with minimal memory overhead. The Linux kernel based operating system's 
                            prominent use in expermiental and cutting edge development in artificial intelligence was an advantage to the 
                            team.
